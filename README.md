Detailed step-by-step guide, for virtualization and operating system installations:

### Installing VirtualBox:

#### Step 1: Download VirtualBox

- Open your web browser and go to the [VirtualBox Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) page.
- Choose the version that corresponds to your host operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
- Click on the download link to start the download.

#### Step 2: Install VirtualBox

- Once the download is complete, locate the installer file and run it.
- Follow the on-screen instructions provided by the installer to install VirtualBox.
- During installation, you may be prompted to install additional components, such as networking features. Accept the default settings unless you have specific requirements.

### Creating a New Virtual Machine (VM):

#### Step 3: Open VirtualBox and Create a New VM

- Launch the VirtualBox application.
- Click on the "New" button in the toolbar to create a new virtual machine.
- Give your virtual machine a name (e.g., "Ubuntu_VM") and choose "Linux" as the type and "Ubuntu" as the version.

#### Step 4: Allocate Memory (RAM)

- Choose the amount of RAM to allocate to your virtual machine. If you're a college student, allocating around 2 GB to 4 GB should be sufficient for basic usage.

#### Step 5: Create a Virtual Hard Disk

- Select "Create a virtual hard disk now" and click "Create."
- Choose the hard disk file type (usually VDI) and click "Next."
- Choose either dynamically allocated or fixed size. If you're unsure, choose dynamically allocated.
- Set the size of the virtual hard disk. A minimum of 25 GB is recommended.

#### Step 6: Specify Disk File Location and Size

- Choose the location where you want to store the virtual disk file and set the size.

### Installing Ubuntu on VirtualBox:

#### Step 7: Mount Ubuntu ISO

- With your new virtual machine selected, click on "Settings."
- Go to the "Storage" tab.
- Under "Controller: IDE," click on the empty disk icon and choose "Choose a disk file."
- Locate and select the Ubuntu ISO file you downloaded earlier.

#### Step 8: Start the Virtual Machine

- Click "Start" to launch the virtual machine.
- The virtual machine will boot from the Ubuntu ISO.

#### Step 9: Install Ubuntu

- Follow the on-screen instructions to install Ubuntu.
- Choose your language and click "Install Ubuntu."
- Follow the installation wizard, including selecting your time zone, keyboard layout, and creating a user account.
- When prompted, choose the option to erase the disk and install Ubuntu (or manually partition if you have specific requirements).

#### Step 10: Complete Installation

- After the installation is complete, eject the installation ISO.
- Restart the virtual machine.

#### Step 11: Post-Installation Steps

- Complete the initial setup, including updating the system and installing any additional software.

You've successfully installed VirtualBox and Ubuntu on your virtual machine.

## Linux directory structure

Explanation of each directory in a typical Linux file system:

1. **`/` (Root Directory):**
   - The root directory is the top-level directory in the Linux file system hierarchy. It contains all other directories and files.

2. **`/home`:**
   - The `/home` directory is the default location for user home directories. Each user typically has a subdirectory within `/home` where they store their personal files and configurations.

3. **`/user`:**
   - This directory appears to be a custom directory for storing user programs. However, it's not a standard directory in a typical Linux file system. User programs are often stored in directories like `/usr/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`.

4. **`/bin` (Binary and Executable Files):**
   - The `/bin` directory contains essential binary and executable files that are required for the system to function, even in single-user mode. Common commands like `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, etc., are located here.

5. **`/etc` (Configuration Files):**
   - The `/etc` directory contains system-wide configuration files and shell scripts that are used to boot and initialize system settings. It also includes configuration files for installed software.

6. **`/apt` (Optional/Third-party Software):**
   - The `/apt` directory seems to be a custom directory for optional or third-party software. However, the standard directory for package management on Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu) is `/etc/apt`.

7. **`/var` (Variable Files):**
   - The `/var` directory contains variable data files that may change as the system runs. This includes log files (`/var/log`), spool directories for mail and print queues, and other files that may grow or change size during the system's operation.

8. **`/temp` (Temporary Files):**
   - The `/temp` directory (typically `/tmp`) is used for temporary files. Programs can store temporary data here, and the system may periodically clean up old files. It's important to note that the correct name for the temporary directory is usually `/tmp`, not `/temp`.

9. **`/mnt` (Mount Point):**
   - The `/mnt` directory is often used as a mount point for temporarily mounting filesystems or devices.

10. **`/opt` (Optional Software):**
    - The `/opt` directory is used for the installation of optional software packages. It provides a way to add software packages from vendors that are not part of the default system.

11. **`/srv` (Service Data):**
    - The `/srv` directory is used to store data for services provided by the system. For example, data for a web server or FTP server might be stored in subdirectories of `/srv`.

12. **`/usr` (User Binaries and Data):**
    - The `/usr` directory contains user-related programs, libraries, documentation, and source code. The `/usr/bin` subdirectory, for instance, holds user binaries (executable files).

Remember that while many Linux systems follow a similar directory structure, there can be variations based on the distribution and specific configurations. The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) is a set of guidelines that many Linux distributions adhere to in order to maintain a consistent directory structure.

These `ls` options provide different views and sorting options for listing files and directories in a directory. Understanding these options can be useful for quickly finding and organizing files based on various criteria such as modification time, visibility, and detailed file information.
