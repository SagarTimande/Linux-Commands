Detailed step-by-step guide, for virtualization and operating system installations:

### Installing VirtualBox:

#### Step 1: Download VirtualBox

- Open your web browser and go to the [VirtualBox Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) page.
- Choose the version that corresponds to your host operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
- Click on the download link to start the download.

#### Step 2: Install VirtualBox

- Once the download is complete, locate the installer file and run it.
- Follow the on-screen instructions provided by the installer to install VirtualBox.
- During installation, you may be prompted to install additional components, such as networking features. Accept the default settings unless you have specific requirements.

### Creating a New Virtual Machine (VM):

#### Step 3: Open VirtualBox and Create a New VM

- Launch the VirtualBox application.
- Click on the "New" button in the toolbar to create a new virtual machine.
- Give your virtual machine a name (e.g., "Ubuntu_VM") and choose "Linux" as the type and "Ubuntu" as the version.

#### Step 4: Allocate Memory (RAM)

- Choose the amount of RAM to allocate to your virtual machine. If you're a college student, allocating around 2 GB to 4 GB should be sufficient for basic usage.

#### Step 5: Create a Virtual Hard Disk

- Select "Create a virtual hard disk now" and click "Create."
- Choose the hard disk file type (usually VDI) and click "Next."
- Choose either dynamically allocated or fixed size. If you're unsure, choose dynamically allocated.
- Set the size of the virtual hard disk. A minimum of 25 GB is recommended.

#### Step 6: Specify Disk File Location and Size

- Choose the location where you want to store the virtual disk file and set the size.

### Installing Ubuntu on VirtualBox:

#### Step 7: Mount Ubuntu ISO

- With your new virtual machine selected, click on "Settings."
- Go to the "Storage" tab.
- Under "Controller: IDE," click on the empty disk icon and choose "Choose a disk file."
- Locate and select the Ubuntu ISO file you downloaded earlier.

#### Step 8: Start the Virtual Machine

- Click "Start" to launch the virtual machine.
- The virtual machine will boot from the Ubuntu ISO.

#### Step 9: Install Ubuntu

- Follow the on-screen instructions to install Ubuntu.
- Choose your language and click "Install Ubuntu."
- Follow the installation wizard, including selecting your time zone, keyboard layout, and creating a user account.
- When prompted, choose the option to erase the disk and install Ubuntu (or manually partition if you have specific requirements).

#### Step 10: Complete Installation

- After the installation is complete, eject the installation ISO.
- Restart the virtual machine.

#### Step 11: Post-Installation Steps

- Complete the initial setup, including updating the system and installing any additional software.

Congratulations! You've successfully installed VirtualBox and Ubuntu on your virtual machine. Feel free to explore and use Ubuntu for your college projects and assignments.
